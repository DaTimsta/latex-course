\makecvtitle

Recent MSc graduate in mathematics and physics. I have a broad scientific interest in both disciplines and a preference towards applying them in interdisciplinary contexts. I'm driven by the methodology of mathematics and physics more than any specific area of research or application. 

\section{Skills}
\cvitem{Personal}{
\begin{itemize}
\item Outgoing. I thrive in the company of others and excel at collaborative work.
\item Quick Learner. I am observant and good at picking up fundamentals in unknown territory.
\item Analytical. I am thorough and logical when approaching a problem.
\item Creative. I have a knack for thinking outside-the-box and attacking problems from several angles.
\item Good communicator. I am experienced in conveying complicated subjects in a clear and precise manner.
\end{itemize}

\section{Education}

\cventry{Nov 2015}{MSc in Mathematics and Physics}{Roskilde University}{}{}{}
\cventry{Jun 2012}{BSc in Mathematics and Physics}{Roskilde University}{}{}{}
\cventry{Aug 2012}{Summer School in X-ray and Neutron Scattering Physics}{Niels Bohr Institute}{}{}{}

\section{Master's Thesis}
\cvitem{Title}{\emph{Structural Changes in Cylinder-Forming PS-b-PB During Solvent Vapor Annealing}}
\cvitem{Supervisor}{Dorthe Posselt}
\cvitem{Description}{Under the supervision of Dorthe Posselt, I performed experiments and data analysis on thin films of the diblock copolymers. The experiments were perfomed at the D1 beamline at CHESS, Cornell University. I was primarily tasked with analysing the large amounts of data that these experiments generate and my work resulted in a set of data analysis tools for future time-resolved GISAXS experiments. In order to better understand the data, scattering spectra were modelled using the BornAgain software package.}


\section{Scientific Talks}
\cventry{Nov 2015}{Diblock Copolymers}{Roskilde University}{}{}{\dskip
Joint talk with Dorthe Posselt held for the Mathematics and Physics group (IMFUFA) at Roskilde University. My part of the talk dealt with the data analysis performed in my master's thesis.}

\eskip

\cventry{Aug 2015}{Scientific Concepts of Scattering Physics}{Niels Bohr Institute}{}{}{\dskip
Talk at a summer school I also attended two years prior. The topic was general concepts of length and time scales and their relation to X-ray and neutron scattering.}

\section{Leisure}

\cvitem{University Life}{During my time at Roskilde University, I was invested in a number of extracurricular activities. This includes tutoring, member of the mathematics study board, presentations at high schools and organizing food at larger social events. These experiences have given me organizational skills, a strong sense of responsibility, confidence in public speaking and the ability to work well in a collaborative environment.}
\cvitem{Programming}{I have had an interest in computers and programming since I was very young. I tend to have small, personal projects lined up at all times and I am an avid user of \url{projecteuler.net}.}
\cvitem{Gaming}{Playing video games have always been a passion of mine. I enjoy the puzzling, challenging nature of a well-crafted game. In addition, I have started to experiment with game-making myself, through the use of Unity3D and UnrealEngine.}
